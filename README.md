Well, I have realised that I have very little knowledge of web development so I decided to create this website to practise. 
There is no higher reason behind it, only self-education and perhaps a place where to store things that I've created 
over the years so that I anyone who's interested can take a look. Enjoy browsing! The files are hosted on my AWS ec2 server. 
I will try to include some PHP and Perl stuff later on. Most of the links are not working at the moment, sorry for that... 
Most of these pictures and videos were created using either Blender or Autodesk Maya. Some sculpting was done in ZBrush 
and video editing in Adobe AfterEffects.
