Well, I have realised that I have very little knowledge of web development so I decided to create this website to practise. There is no higher reason behind it, only self-education and perhaps a place where to store things that I've created over the years so that I anyone who's interested can take a look. Enjoy browsing! The files are hosted on my AWS ec2 server. I will try to include some PHP and Perl stuff later on. Most of the links are not working at the moment, sorry for that... Most of these pictures and videos were created using either Blender or Autodesk Maya. Some sculpting was done in ZBrush and video editing in Adobe AfterEffects.
There will be some sub-project on this website, such as webapps and games. All of them are listed below.

## [TicTacToe](http://lejhanec.com/TicTacToe.html)
A simple tic tac toe game with a computer AI. It's using the MiniMAx AI model to predicd the best possible move. You can start the game, or tell the computer to start, but either way you can't win.
It was built following a Youtube tutorial with my own bits and pieces added.

## [Arcade](http://lejhanec.com/arcade.html)
A simple pong game with various difficulty levels. AI is made by restricting the movements of a computer to make it possible to beat him. The game speed increases at higher difficulty levels and so does the maximum movement speed of the computer movements.
It was built following a Udemy tutorial with my own bits and pieces added.
